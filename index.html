      <div class="aboutus__text">
        <p>
          Venatus is known to provide high-end gear for event management and
          create major events attracting crowd from outside Delhi as well. Our
          gamers have been very notable in the gaming competitions held
          throughout Delhi, retaining their lead in every major tournament.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have previously collaborated with the Education Tree, Dew Arena,
          Paradise Gamers, Burger King, Battle Groups Cafe, Nexus Gaming Cafe,
          Nodwin Gaming, Immortal Gaming Cafe, among many others.
        </p>

        <p>
          We keep two annual events every year on our college campus, namely:
          AIMBOT for Esports and SEEK: for Outdoors. As a nonprofit
          organization, we have managed to raise over 5.6lakh rupees in a period
          of 3 years and 90% was reinvested to provide quality service and
          gaming platform. The society organizes a recruitment drive every year
          in the month of August, focusing on building a reliable, efficient,
          hard-working and motivated team to lead the society.
        </p>

        <p>
          The outdoor section has received sponsorship from big names like
          Zomato, Croma, Akash Institue, among others. who provide prizes and
          logistics to carry out these events.Lastly, Venatus also takes part in
          CSR. As a duty to our society - every year we organize one event for
          either social awareness or for helping economically backward
          children.In 2019, we organized MATDAAN as an election awareness
          campaign among our youth and it aimed at creating awareness about the
          importance of voting and understanding the complete polling process.

          So aforementioned was a snapshot of life as a member of Venatus - The
          Gaming Society of NSUT, where we create a family-like atmosphere for
          all members -new and old alike, a place where everyone gets a chance
          to hone their skills in the four years of our college, a place where
          fun and learning never halts.
